1) Introduction
=================================================
ImageCaptionLearn_py is the learning component of the
Entity-Based Scene Understanding project. It contains the
functionality necessary for training models for predicting
nonvisual mentions, relations between mentions, mention cardinality,
and the affinity between mentions and boxes.

=================================================
2) Modules
=================================================
Most of the ImageCaptionLearn_py files are in the top level (or rather,
they do not belong to a specific module), as they are intended to be
run, rather than serve as components of some other file. In general, these files
are either linear classifiers using Scikit-Learn, (e.g. icl_relation, icl_nonvisual)
or are neural classifiers using Tensorflow (e.g. icl_affinity_lstm, icl_relation_lstm).
Of special note is icl_core_lstm, which handles nonvisual and cardinality prediction
(which use identical neural architectures), and icl_multitask_lstm, which was an
attempt to train all component classifiers jointly (this took far too long
to train with little to no benefit in performance).

a) nn_utils
    Hosting a number of neural network utilities, the files in
    this module contain functions to do things from producing
    weights placeholders in tensorflow to setting up the common
    bidirectional LSTM architecture used in the neural classifiers to
    evaluating multiclass classification performance
b) utils
    The utils module contains various useful functions for manipulating
    strings, scoring predictions, interfacing with Word2Vec embeddings, and
    similar.
